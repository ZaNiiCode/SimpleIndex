<h1>Welcome to Zain Cruz's Webpage!</h1>
<hr/>
<p> This webpage will represent a breif
summary of me and serve as a basis for my future projects!</p>
<hr/>
<p> To get to know me, you first must understand the webpages that I live on!
  I have even done a review on some of the sites I am going to talk about that
  can be found on my blog here: <a href="https://cruzinforlife.blogspot.com/"
  title="My blog!"> My blog!</a></p>
 <div class = "tab"> The first of these sites of course is Crunchyroll which
  can be found here <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" title="Crunchyroll.">
    Crunchyroll.</a>In a way I do feel as though this site really
    does help one understand exactly the kind of extreme nerd that I am. As
    mentiond in my blog, it is a streaming service site that contains all of the
    newest as well as timeless classic animes. Below is a list of some of my
    favorites that I am currently watching, as well as an image of the Crunchyroll
  mascot, "Hime."

    <ul id="uoListTypes">
          <li>Shield Hero</li>
          <li>Darling in the Franxx</li>
          <li>Sailor Moon</li>
          <li>Black Lagoon</li>
          <li>Sword Art Online</li>
        </ul>
</div>
        <img id="Hime" src="https://shortyawards.imgix.net/entries/11th/acdebb7d-993b-4f66-8fba-cf29ed83461b.png?auto=format&fit=crop&h=300&q=65&w=500&s=9c87124a5a9e952c9423a47365624f5b"
        width="237" height="178" alt="Hime"><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <div class="tab"> Crunchyroll certainly has to be my favorite, however
  another streaming service I use often is <a href="https://www.funimation.com/"
  title="Funimation"> Funimation</a> which is also for anime. The reason
  for such is not that I would ever betray Hime, but instead because Funimation
  actually hosts certain animes that crunchyroll does not carry!
  Certain animes such as:

          <ul id="uorListTypes">
                <li>Initial D</li>
                <li>A3</li>
                <li>Fate: Grand Order</li>
                <li>and Nanabun no nijuuni</li>
              </ul>

              are not available on crunchyroll. This begs the most important
              question (at least in my mind) of which anime streaimg powerhouse
              is the better service. Unlinke <span style="color : orange">Crunchyroll's sporty
                orange</span>, Funimation sports a
                <span style="color : purple"> classy purple
                </span> in their logo down below.</div><br>

<img id="Himee" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/funimation_logo.png"
                width="237" height="200" alt="Crunchyroll"><br><br>


<div class="tab"> These are relevant sources in my life that could help
  anyone understand more about me and my love for pop culture (being a nerd).
  So in order finalize our decison on which is the superior streaming site
  in my humble opinion, lets compare and contrast!

  <h3>Comparison of Tycoons</h3>
    <table id="tableData">


    				<caption><b>Crunchroll vs Funimation</b></caption>


    					<thead>
    						<tr>
    							<td colspan="4"><b>Best Anime Streaming Service</b></td>
    						</tr>
    					</thead>



    					<tfoot>

    						<tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr>
    					</tfoot>


    					<tbody>
    						<tr>
    							<td></td>
    							<td>HD Quality</td>
    							<td>Server Connections</td>
    							<td>User Interface</td>
                  <td>Total</td>
    						</tr>

    						<tr>
    							<td><b>Crunchyroll</b></td>
    							<td>9</td>
    							<td>7</td>
    							<td>10</td>
                  <td>8.67</td>
    						</tr>

    						<tr>
    							<td><b>Funimation</b></td>
    							<td>9</td>
    							<td>6</td>
    							<td>9</td>
                  <td>8</td>
    						</tr>


    					</tbody>

    				</table>


<div class="tab"> WOW! as any of us would have guessed this race was as close
  as ever! To elaboarte on the ratings, both have exccelent HD quality, however
  when not combined with high internet speeds the quality <i>may</i> suffer. That
  brings me to the next score of server connections which both lack in obtaining sometimes.
  Due to this, one cold have good enough connection to run Instagram or Youtube for example
  but these apps would still be unable to load. I find at times where Funimation does not load
  though, crunchyroll still can, resulting in a plus 1 for Hime. Lastly, as I wrote in my blog,
  the user interface within crunchyroll is simply unbeatable, and so for that reason crunchyroll
  takes my #1 spot for <b><strong>BEST</strong></b> anime streaming service.


</div>
<div class="tab"> I hope that through this fun artice and comparison you were able
  to learn more about me and my interests as a pop culture nerd. Stay tuned for future
  update and projects on this site! Stay cool!
